# Credit-Risk-Projects

This is a project for Credit and Weather Derivatives course at University of Bologna.

Price of zero coupon bounds are computed by calibrating Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model to swap rates and applying bootstrapping. Then survival and default probability for a Credit Default Swap (CDS) are calulated considering a time inhomogeneous Poisson process with piece-wise constant intensity rate. The aim is to master bootstrapping technique, and also to practice modeling on real market data.
